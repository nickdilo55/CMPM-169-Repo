				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to accomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I wanted to have a fun experience within a TV static screen, like an easter egg hunt but with text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I used several functions to update the pixels on the screen and also to set a random position of the text upon spawning it in/clicking it..</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>No issues, I implemented every part at a time so the only problem was when clicking the text wouldn't make it disappear.</p>
